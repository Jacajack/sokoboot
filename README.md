# sokoboot
A Sokoban clone bootable from floppy (probably, tested only in `qemu`). I made this thing just for fun, to try out my assembly skills. I doubt this thing will ever become fully functional game, but who knows? If you are interested in this project, all questions and contributions are welcome.
