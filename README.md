# sokoboot
A Sokoban clone bootable from floppy (just write `img` file to floppy disk using `dd` or if you've got Windows - a cool piece of software called [rawwrite](http://www.chrysocome.net/rawwrite)). I made this thing just for fun, to try out my assembly skills. I doubt this thing will ever become fully functional game, but who knows? If you are interested in this project, all questions and contributions are welcome.


This is how it looks:<br>

TODO:
  - [x] - game engine
  - [x] - scene rendering
  - [ ] - menus
  - [ ] - loading levels
